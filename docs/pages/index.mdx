# Welcome to Radius Documentation

Radius is a stablecoin-native EVM network architected for linear scalability with sub-second finality.

## What is Radius?

Radius reimagines blockchain infrastructure by building natively around stablecoins and payments. Unlike traditional blockchains that bolt payments on top, Radius embeds stablecoin economics into its core protocol—enabling features like stablecoin-native fees, real-time finality, and purpose-built scaling.

## Key Features

**Architected for Scale**
- Linear scaling through sharding
- Sub-second finality
- High throughput without compromise

**Designed for the Internet of Tomorrow**
- Osaka hardfork EVM compatibility
- Full Solidity toolchain support
- Native stablecoin integration

**Stablecoin-Native Fees**
- Pay transaction fees in USDC or other stablecoins
- Turnstile mechanism ensures network stability
- No need to manage gas token balances

## Get Started

Choose your path:

- **New to Radius?** Start with [Architected for Scale](/differentiators/architected-for-scale) to understand the network
- **Ready to build?** Jump to [Quick Start: First Payment](/build-deploy/quick-start-first-payment)
- **Integrating a wallet?** Check out [Wallet Integration](/build-deploy/wallet-integration)
- **Need API reference?** See the [JSON-RPC API](/developer-resources/json-rpc-api)
