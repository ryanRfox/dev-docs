# Welcome to Radius Documentation

Radius is a stablecoin-native payments network architected for linear scalability with sub-second transaction finality.

## What is Radius?

Radius was built from the ground to be the most performant payment network architecture possible. 
Instead of treating payments as an afterthought, we enshrined stablecoins at the foundation of the network. 
This enables lowests cost transaction fees denominated in USD stablecoins instead of volatile cryptocurrencies, instant transaction settlement, and the responsive infrastructure required for internet-scale applications.
