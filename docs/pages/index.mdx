# Welcome to Radius Documentation

Radius is a stablecoin-native payments network architected for linear scalability with sub-second transaction finality.

## What is Radius?

Radius was built from the ground to be the most performant payment network architecture possible. 
Instead of treating payments as an afterthought, we enshrined stablecoins at the foundation of the network. 
This enables lowests cost transaction fees denominated in USD stablecoins instead of volatile cryptocurrencies, instant transaction settlement, and the responsive infrastructure required for internet-scale applications.

## Key Features

**Architected for Scale**
- Scales horizontally—add infrastructure, add throughput
- Instant settlement—transactions final in milliseconds
- High throughput without compromise

**Designed for the Internet of Tomorrow**
- Ethereum-compatible—deploy existing Solidity contracts unchanged
- Full Solidity toolchain support
- Native stablecoin integration

**Stablecoin-Native Fees**
- Pay transaction fees in USDC or other stablecoins
- Turnstile mechanism ensures network stability
- No need to manage gas token balances
