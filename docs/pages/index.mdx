# Radius Network [Documentation, integration guides, and developer resources]

## Welcome

Radius delivers a stablecoin-native payment network with sub-second finality and linear scalability.
Build from first-principles, our dynamic infrastrucutre provides the transactional throughput for internet-scale applications.
Pay transactions natively in USD, settle in 200ms, and build using established developer tooling.

This docs site is designed to move technical leads deeper beyond our [marketing overview](https://radiustech.xyz/) and enable developers to successfully build at scale on the Radius Network.
