# Stablecoin-Native Fees

## Overview

Radius Network enables you to pay gas fees directly in stablecoins (USD) rather than requiring native tokens. This eliminates a major friction point for users: the need to acquire and manage multiple tokens. On Radius, if your wallet has enough stablecoins to cover gas costs, you can send transactions without holding native tokens.

This feature is called **Stablecoin-Native Fees**, and it works automatically—no special code, configuration, or wallet changes required.

## How It Works

When you submit a transaction, Radius uses a transparent mechanism to bridge the gap between stablecoin and native token needs:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Radius detects when a user lacks sufficient native tokens to pay gas
2. **USD Conversion**: If the user holds enough stablecoins (USD), Radius converts just enough USD to provide the necessary native tokens
3. **Single Transaction**: The conversion happens seamlessly as part of the same transaction execution
4. **No Extra Charges**: Users are not charged gas for the conversion process itself

Wallets show an "effective balance" that accounts for convertible stablecoins, so users see they can afford their transaction.

## Developer Impact

As a developer building on Radius Network, **you don't need to do anything special** to support Stablecoin-Native Fees. Here's what this means for you:

- **No API Changes**: Standard Ethereum RPC calls work exactly as expected
- **No Contract Modifications**: Your smart contracts don't need updates
- **Transparent to Users**: Your users get the benefit automatically when they submit transactions
- **Improved UX**: Users can transact with just stablecoins, reducing onboarding friction

The feature handles everything behind the scenes. Your dApp works on Radius exactly like it works on any other EVM chain, with the added benefit of stablecoin fee support.

## RPC Behavior

Radius implements Stablecoin-Native Fees consistently across all relevant RPC methods:

### eth_sendRawTransaction
When a user submits a signed transaction:
- If they have enough native tokens, it executes normally
- If they lack native tokens but have sufficient USD, the conversion executes automatically
- The transaction state is committed, including any USD conversions
- The user receives confirmation that their transaction succeeded

### eth_call and eth_estimateGas
When you simulate or estimate transaction costs:
- Results assume the Stablecoin-Native Fee mechanism is available
- If a user would lack native tokens, the simulation assumes the conversion happens
- You get accurate estimates even if the user's wallet only contains stablecoins

### eth_getBalance
When wallets check user balances:
- The returned balance includes native tokens the user currently holds
- **Plus** the native token equivalent of their convertible stablecoins
- This ensures wallets like MetaMask accurately represent what users can spend
- The balance reflects the total gas-paying power available to the user

## Pricing

Stablecoin-Native Fees have a transparent, minimal cost structure:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Cost per transaction** | 0.0001 USD |
| **Transactions per 1 USD** | 10,000 |
| **Cost per 1,000 txns** | 0.10 USD |
| **Minimum threshold** | 0.001 USD |

This pricing structure makes Stablecoin-Native Fees practical for all transaction volumes, from small payments to high-frequency trading.

## Example Scenario

Here's how Stablecoin-Native Fees work in practice:

**User's Wallet State:**
- Native tokens: 0
- Stablecoins (USD): 10 USD

**User Action:**
- Submits a transaction requiring gas

**What Happens:**
1. Radius detects the user lacks native tokens
2. Radius converts the required amount of USD to native tokens
3. The transaction executes with the converted native tokens
4. Gas is paid, transaction completes

**User Experience:**
- No wallet switching needed
- No bridging or swapping required
- Transaction sent and confirmed in one step

## When Conversion Activates

Stablecoin-Native Fees activate automatically when both conditions are met:

1. User's native token balance is insufficient to cover the transaction's gas cost
2. User's USD balance is sufficient to generate the required native tokens

If either condition isn't met, the transaction fails with insufficient funds.

## Best Practices

While Stablecoin-Native Fees work automatically, keep these in mind:

- **User Education**: Let users know they can transact with stablecoins alone
- **Gas Estimation**: Use `eth_estimateGas` as normal—it accounts for conversions automatically
- **Balance Display**: Consider showing "total transaction capacity" to help users understand their full spending power
- **Error Handling**: Handle insufficient USD the same way you'd handle insufficient funds on any chain

## FAQ

**Do I need to implement anything special in my dApp?**
No. Stablecoin-Native Fees are handled by Radius automatically at the protocol level.

**Will my smart contract code change?**
No. Your contracts work unchanged. The conversion happens at the RPC level before your contract executes.

**Can I disable Stablecoin-Native Fees?**
No, and you don't need to. It's a protocol feature that benefits all users without affecting contract behavior.

**What if a user lacks sufficient USD?**
The transaction fails with insufficient funds, like any other chain.

**Are there security implications?**
No. The conversion happens atomically within the same transaction, maintaining all security guarantees.

**How does this affect gas calculations?**
It doesn't. Use `eth_estimateGas` as normal—it returns accurate estimates.
