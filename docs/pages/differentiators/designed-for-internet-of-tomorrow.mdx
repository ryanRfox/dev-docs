# Designed for the Internet of Tomorrow

Radius is EVM-compatible — your Solidity contracts deploy without modification using Foundry, your ethers.js code works, your viem integration works. Radius runs Solidity contracts but with fundamentally different economics and architecture. This page covers what works, what's different, and why those differences matter for the future of internet payments.

## What Works

Your existing Ethereum development workflow transfers directly to Radius:

| Tool/Framework | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| **Solidity** | Fully supported (Osaka hardfork) |
| **Foundry** | Compatible |
| **ethers.js** | Compatible |
| **viem** | Compatible |
| **OpenZeppelin** | Compatible |
| **Standard precompiles** | All Osaka precompiles available |

### Deploy Existing Contracts

```bash
forge create src/MyContract.sol:MyContract \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.testnet.radiustech.xyz \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Connect Your Application

```typescript
// ethers.js v6
import { JsonRpcProvider } from "ethers";
const provider = new JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc.testnet.radiustech.xyz");

// viem
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
const client = createPublicClient({
  transport: http("https://rpc.testnet.radiustech.xyz")
});
```

## What's Different from Other EVMs

Radius optimizes for payments. This means deliberate differences from standard Ethereum behavior:

### Predictable Fees (Not Market-Dependent)

Traditional blockchain fees fluctuate with network demand. Radius charges a fixed $0.001 per transaction—predictable, auditable, and calculable.

### Stablecoin Fees

| Ethereum | Radius |
|----------|--------|
| Fees paid in ETH | Fees paid in stablecoins (SBC) |
| Must hold native token | No separate gas token needed |
| `eth_gasPrice` returns market rate | Returns `0x0` |

### Faster Finality

| Ethereum | Radius |
|----------|--------|
| ~12 minutes for high confidence | Immediate |
| 12+ confirmations recommended | 0 confirmations needed |
| Reorgs possible | No reorgs |

## Key Differences from Ethereum

| Feature | Ethereum | Radius |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Fee model** | Market-based (ETH bids) | Fixed $0.00001 (stablecoins) |
| **Settlement time** | 12+ minutes | Instant (milliseconds) |
| **Failed txs** | Charge gas even if reverted | Charge only on success |
| **Required token** | Must hold ETH | Optional (stablecoins work) |

### Practical Implications

**Your contracts work unchanged:**
```solidity
// Standard ERC-20 interactions
IERC20(token).transfer(recipient, amount);

// Storage operations
mapping(address => uint256) balances;
balances[msg.sender] = 100;

// Events
emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
```

**Avoid native balance patterns:**
```solidity
// Don't do this (always returns 0)
require(address(this).balance > 0);

// Do this instead
require(IERC20(feeToken).balanceOf(address(this)) > 0);
```

## How Radius Ensures Data Integrity

Radius uses operator trust + replication rather than decentralized consensus:
- 3-node clusters provide fault tolerance (operator nodes replicate data)
- Cryptographic signing prevents tampering
- Deterministic execution ensures consistency

This trade-off (known operators for instant finality) is appropriate for payment infrastructure.

## Future-Proofing

Radius is built for where the internet is going, not where it's been.

### Real-Time Autonomous Payments

AI agents need to pay for services (APIs, data, compute) instantly. Traditional payment processors require 30+ day settlement. Radius provides:
- **Instant settlement** — Agent gets confirmation in milliseconds
- **Sub-cent costs** — Enables per-request pricing
- **Stablecoin support** — Agents don't need volatile assets

### Micropayments

When transactions cost $0.001, new business models become viable:

- **Per-request API billing**: Charge per call, not monthly
- **Content micropayments**: Pay per article, not subscription
- **Streaming payments**: Pay by the second for compute

Traditional payment processors (Stripe, PayPal) can't economically support these patterns. Radius can.

### EIP Support (Osaka)

Radius tracks the Osaka hardfork via Revm 33.1.0:

| EIP | Support |
|-----|---------|
| EIP-7702 | Set EOA account code |
| EIP-1559 | Fee market (adapted for stablecoins) |
| EIP-2930 | Access lists |
| EIP-4844 | Blob transactions |

### Precompiles

All standard precompiles plus Radius extensions:

| Address | Precompile |
|---------|------------|
| `0x01` - `0x0a` | Standard Ethereum precompiles |
| `0x4Db27Fa...` | Radius Edge (external data) |
| `0x07a2bA2...` | Debug utilities |
